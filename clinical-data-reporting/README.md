# Clinical Data Reporting & Analysis (n8n Dummy Project)

## Overview
This dummy n8n project demonstrates an automated workflow for pulling clinical data from disparate sources, performing transformations, and generating automated reports. This aims to provide better insights into patient outcomes, operational efficiency, or other key performance indicators (KPIs) without manual data aggregation.

## Problem Addressed
Healthcare organizations often have clinical data scattered across various systems (EHRs, lab systems, billing, patient portals). Manually pulling, cleaning, and consolidating this data for reporting is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to errors.

## n8n Solution
This n8n workflow is designed to:
1.  **Extract Data:** Simulate pulling raw clinical data from various sources (e.g., a dummy Google Sheet representing an EHR export).
2.  **Transform Data:** Clean, filter, aggregate, and enrich the data as needed (e.g., calculate patient ages, group by diagnosis).
3.  **Generate Report:** Output the transformed data into a report format (e.g., write to a new Google Sheet, generate a CSV, or prepare data for a dashboard).

## Workflow Description
The core of this automation involves:
* **Schedule Trigger Node:** To initiate the report generation on a recurring basis (e.g., weekly, monthly).
* **Google Sheets Node (Read):** To simulate extracting raw clinical data from a source spreadsheet.
* **Code Node / Edit Fields (Set) Node:** For complex data transformations, filtering, and aggregation logic to prepare the data for reporting.
* **Google Sheets Node (Write) / HTTP Request Node:** To simulate generating and "publishing" the final report (e.g., writing to a dedicated report sheet or sending to a mock dashboard API).

## Setup for Dummy Project
To run this dummy project in your n8n instance:
1.  **Import the workflow:** Download `clinical_data_report_workflow.json` from this folder and import it into your n8n instance.
2.  **Dummy Data:** You will need to create a dummy Google Sheet with sample clinical data. A `data/dummy_clinical_data.csv` is provided for reference to help you structure your sheet.

## Files in This Folder
* `README.md`: This file.
* `clinical_data_report_workflow.json`: The exported n8n workflow for clinical data reporting.
* `data/dummy_clinical_data.csv`: A sample CSV file containing dummy clinical data.

## Future Enhancements
* Integration with actual EHR/LIMS/Billing system APIs for live data extraction.
* Generating more complex reports (e.g., PDF, direct dashboard updates).
* Advanced analytics and machine learning integration for predictive insights.
* Automated distribution of reports via email or secure file transfer.
