# Internal Clinic Management (n8n Dummy Project)

## Overview
This dummy n8n project demonstrates automating various internal administrative tasks within a healthcare clinic, such as managing supply orders or staff scheduling. The goal is to improve operational efficiency and reduce manual workload for clinic administrators.

## Problem Addressed
Many internal clinic operations, like ordering new supplies or assigning tasks, often involve manual forms, emails, or disjointed systems. This leads to inefficiencies, delays, and potential errors in day-to-day management.

## n8n Solution
This n8n workflow is designed to:
1.  **Receive Internal Requests:** Simulate receiving requests for internal tasks (e.g., a supply order via a webhook form).
2.  **Process Request:** Extract relevant details, categorize the request, and validate data.
3.  **Integrate with Tools:** Simulate integration with external management tools (e.g., a mock inventory system, a mock task management board).
4.  **Send Notifications:** Send automated internal notifications (e.g., via mock Slack/Email).

## Workflow Description
The core of this automation involves:
* **Webhook Trigger Node:** To initiate the workflow upon receiving an internal request (e.g., a new supply order form submission).
* **Edit Fields (Set) Node:** To normalize and prepare the incoming request data.
* **Code Node:** For custom logic to categorize or validate the request (e.g., identify high-priority orders).
* **HTTP Request Node(s):** To simulate sending data to mock inventory/task management/calendar APIs.
* **HTTP Request Node (for Notifications):** To simulate sending notifications to internal communication platforms (e.g., mock Slack/Microsoft Teams/Email).

## Setup for Dummy Project
To run this dummy project in your n8n instance:
1.  **Import the workflow:** Download `internal_management_workflow.json` from this folder and import it into your n8n instance.
2.  **Dummy Data:** The workflow uses a `Webhook` to simulate incoming requests. `data/dummy_supply_order.json` is provided for testing.

## Files in This Folder
* `README.md`: This file.
* `internal_management_workflow.json`: The exported n8n workflow for internal clinic management.
* `data/dummy_supply_order.json`: A sample JSON payload for a supply order request.

## Future Enhancements
* Integration with actual inventory management systems (e.g., NetSuite, custom ERP).
* Direct integration with task management tools (e.g., Asana, Trello, Jira) or calendar apps (Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar).
* Approval workflows for high-value orders.
* Integration with internal communication platforms like Slack or Microsoft Teams.
